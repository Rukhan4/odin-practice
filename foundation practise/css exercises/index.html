<!-- ---------------------EXERCISE 1-------------------------------------------
In this exercise, you're going to practice adding CSS to an HTML file using 
all three methods: external CSS, internal CSS, and inline CSS. You should 
only be using type selectors for this exercise when adding styles via the 
external and internal methods. You should also use keywords for colors 
(e.g. "blue") instead of using RGB or HEX values.

There are three elements for you to add styles to, each of which uses a 
different method of adding CSS to it, as noted in the outcome image below. 
All other exercises in this section will have a CSS file provided and 
linked for you, but for this exercise you will have to create the file 
and link it in the HTML file yourself. This is all about practicing 
using these different methods and getting the syntax right.

All odd numbered elements: a light red/pink background, and a list of fonts 
containing Verdana and DejaVu Sans with sans-serif as a fallback
The second element: blue text and a font size of 36px
The third element: in addition to the styles for all odd numbered elements, 
add a font size of 24px
The fourth element: a light green background, a font size of 24px, and bold

We have two images for you to style, each with two class names, where one of the class names is shared. The goal here is
to chain the selectors for both elements, so that each have a unique style applied, despite using a shared class
selector. For example, you want an element that has both X and Y to have one set of styles, while an element with X and
Z has a completely different set of styles. We included the original images as well, so that you can see how the styles
you will be adding look in comparison, so do not add any styles to them.

The properties you need to add to each element are:

Make the element with both the avatar and proportioned classes 300 pixels wide, then give it a height so that it retains
its original square proportions (don't hardcode in a pixel value for the height!).
Make the element with both the avatar and distorted classes 200 pixels wide, then make its height twice as big as its
width (here you should hardcode in a pixel value).

<!-- ---------------------EXERCISE 5-------------------------------------------

Understanding how combinators work can become a lot easier when you start playing around with them and see what exactly
is affected by them versus what isn't.

The goal of this exercise is to apply styles to elements that are descendants of another element, while leaving elements
that aren't descendants of that element unstyled.

You can use either type or class selectors for this exercise; use whichever you may feel you want to practice with more.
The HTML file is set up (so no need to edit anything in it) such that any combination of selectors will work, so if
you're feeling adventurous you can even try combining a type and class selector for the descendant combinator.
The properties you need to add are:

Only the p elements that are descendants of the div element should have a yellow background, red text, a font size of
20px, and center aligned.
