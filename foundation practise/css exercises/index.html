<!-- ---------------------EXERCISE 1-------------------------------------------
In this exercise, you're going to practice adding CSS to an HTML file using 
all three methods: external CSS, internal CSS, and inline CSS. You should 
only be using type selectors for this exercise when adding styles via the 
external and internal methods. You should also use keywords for colors 
(e.g. "blue") instead of using RGB or HEX values.

There are three elements for you to add styles to, each of which uses a 
different method of adding CSS to it, as noted in the outcome image below. 
All other exercises in this section will have a CSS file provided and 
linked for you, but for this exercise you will have to create the file 
and link it in the HTML file yourself. This is all about practicing 
using these different methods and getting the syntax right.
