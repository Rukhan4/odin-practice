    <p>Roti is a Trinidadian born flatbread made of atta grains
        usually paired with some form of curry
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 lbs boneless skinless chicken thighs (cut into bit size pieces)</li>
        <li>1 bulb of garlic (or more if you desire)</li>
        <li>4 bay leaves</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cloves</li>
        <li>3 teaspoons ground ginger</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon marjoram</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon turmeric</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon yellow mustard seeds (grounded)</li>
        <li>2-3 ounces curry powder (suit to your taste or color)</li>
        <li>1 chicken bouillon cube (if you'd like to salt your curry)</li>
        <li>2 potatoes</li>
        <li>1 eggplant</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Recipe:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the chicken into <strong>bit size pieces</strong>. Add garlic and mix into chicken.
            In a separate bowl mix all of the spices and curry powder together (but not the bay leaves). Slowly add
            spice mixture into chicken/garlic while mixing by hand to ensure even coverage. Set the mixed chicken aside
            to sit for a while while you make the Roti.</li>
        <li>Boil water and let the water cool until you can handle it with your hands (you'll be kneading the Roti
            dough).
            Mix 4 cups of flour with the salt and then add the hot water until it is moist but not sticky. You want the
            consistency of a flat dough that will be rolled out using a wooden rolling pin.</li>
        <li>Take a little more than half a stick of room temperature butter and add it to the flour and water mixture.
            This will keep the dough from sticking to your hand and itself.
            Use judgment for rolling consistency. Flour flat surface and rolling pin and form dough into balls. Roll
            balls out to flat and thin consistency, about 6-7 inches. Heat up your frying pan to medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>After my Roti is done, I begin with the curry -- although you can always do both at the same time too.</li>
        <li>Pour just enough oil to cover the bottom of a large pot. Place 4 bigger bay leaves into the pot and warm oil
            on medium for a few minutes (before the bay leaves turn brown).</li>
        <li>Turn heat to high and add chicken. Cook at high heat stirring every minute for 10 minutes, then turn to
            medium/medium low heat. Use your judgment when cooking at high heat because you don't want the chicken to
            stick or burn. If the pot is lacking any liquid from the high temperature, add small amounts of water or
            chicken stock. As the chicken cooks longer, the juices are released. Use your judgment.</li>
        <li>5 minutes after turning the heat from high to medium/medium low, add the cubed potatoes and eggplant. When
            potatoes are done, the curry is done. Make sure the eggplant is dissolved into the curry.</li>
